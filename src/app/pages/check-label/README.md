# Check Label Feature

## Overview
The Check Label component provides quality control functionality to compare sample labels with printed labels using camera-based image capture and analysis.

## Features

### üì∑ Camera Integration
- Real-time camera feed with high-resolution capture (1920x1080)
- Automatic back camera selection on mobile devices
- Visual guidelines for proper label positioning
- Capture controls with large, accessible buttons

### üè∑Ô∏è Label Comparison
- **Sample Label Capture**: Take photos of reference/master labels
- **Printed Label Capture**: Take photos of newly printed labels
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Visual comparison interface
- **Automated Analysis**: AI-powered quality assessment

### üìä Quality Assessment
The system analyzes three key aspects:
1. **Size & Dimensions**: Label size, width, height matching
2. **Font Style**: Typography and font family consistency
3. **Text Size**: Character height and scaling verification

### üìã Results & Reporting
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Clear quality control decisions
- **Confidence Scores**: Percentage-based accuracy ratings
- **Detailed Results**: Individual component assessment
- **Report Download**: JSON format for record keeping

## How to Use

1. **Start Camera**: Click "Start Camera" to activate the camera feed
2. **Capture Sample**: Position your reference label and capture
3. **Capture Printed**: Position your printed label and capture
4. **Auto-Compare**: System automatically analyzes both images
5. **Review Results**: Check the pass/fail status and detailed metrics
6. **Download Report**: Save comparison results for quality records

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- **Camera API**: `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure HTTPS connection
- Check browser permissions
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify camera is not in use by other apps

### Poor Image Quality
- Improve lighting conditions
- Keep labels flat and straight
- Maintain consistent distance
- Avoid shadows and reflections

### Comparison Issues
- Ensure both sample and printed labels are captured
- Retake images if quality is poor
- Check that labels are properly aligned
- Verify sufficient image contrast
